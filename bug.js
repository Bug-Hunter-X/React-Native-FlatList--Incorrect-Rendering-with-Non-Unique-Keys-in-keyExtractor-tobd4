This error occurs when using the `FlatList` component in React Native and providing a `keyExtractor` function that doesn't return unique keys for each item.  This leads to unexpected behavior, such as incorrect rendering, incorrect item positioning and performance issues. For example:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{id: 1, name: 'Item 1'}, {id: 1, name: 'Item 2'}]}
  keyExtractor={(item) => item.id}
  renderItem={({item}) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
```

In this example, the `keyExtractor` uses the `id` field, but the IDs are not unique. This will cause problems.
